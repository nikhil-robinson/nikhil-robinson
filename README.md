### About Me ðŸ˜„
I'm an embedded developer who loves to use the "I" pronoun - I mean, who doesn't love talking about themselves, am I right? When I'm not busy coding, you can usually find me bragging about my latest project to anyone who will listen. But don't worry, I'm not all talk - I'm also pretty good at what I do. In fact, I'm so good that I sometimes feel like I should just change my name to "I" and be done with it. So if you're looking for a talented embedded developer who's not afraid to put themselves first, look no further - I'm your person!
